👋 Hi, I’m Ivan Cherednichenko and I am a voodoo programer in Pascal/Delphi. Also I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I have a little experience of JSON, XML and VBScript.
<br />
My first language was Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5 after were Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0 and Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0.
<br />
I work with Pascal/Delphi since 2004 in Borland Delphi 7. Delphi is a wonderful and powerful world for me. I wrote some programs and tools like <a href='http://www.chpas.narod.ru/quickpage.html'>Quick Page</a> (developing since 2004), <a href='http://www.chpas.narod.ru/airplane.html'>Airplane</a>, <a href='http://www.chpas.narod.ru/chmbuilder.html'>CHM Builder</a>, <a href='http://www.chpas.narod.ru/htmltreeview.html'>HTML Tree View Generator</a> and <a href='http://www.chpas.narod.ru/products.html'>other</a> (you can see it on my web-site: http://www.chpas.narod.ru). My future programs and tools also will be appear here.
<br />
I try to develop my JavaScript library and it will be good idea if I place it in GitHub.
<br />
You can find my other interests on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbt_RqZWVcfQvxWClWC44bg'>YouTube-channel</a>. I have some <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gE2NsYGmas&list=PL1iMpJvHBb0974fkWAwQK5dRm00LT-i-_'>interesting ideas about Fermat's Last Theorem</a>. 
<br />
I have no commercial software developer experience yet but I would like to have it.

<p>
👀 I’m interested in developing of my Quick Page and JavaScript library and earning by programing.
</p>
<p>
🌱 I’m currently learning in Pascal/Delphi and Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript...). Also I think about Python, C#, Java or C++.
</p>
<p>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on people who can learning and teaching.
